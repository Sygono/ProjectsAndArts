# ProjectsAndArts

Repository Description:

This GitHub repository is managed by Shawn Gao, a member of the University of California, Berkeley community. The repository contains a diverse collection of projects related to 3D modeling, robotics simulation, computational algorithms, and machine learning. Here's a breakdown of the repository's contents:

Arts: 3D Models Work with Blender

In the "Arts" section, you will find a collection of 3D models created using Blender. These models are the result of creative and artistic endeavors and demonstrate proficiency in 3D modeling and design. It's a showcase of visually appealing, digitally crafted objects and scenes.

Bot: Simulation of 3D Inverse Kinematics and a Spider Robot

The "Bot" section contains simulations related to 3D inverse kinematics and a spider robot. This area of the repository likely focuses on robotics and motion control. Inverse kinematics is a key concept in robotics, and the inclusion of a spider robot suggests experimentation with complex legged locomotion.

Hexcoord: Simulation of the Wave Function Collapse Algorithm on a Hex Coordinate Grid

Within "Hexcoord," you'll find simulations that implement the wave function collapse algorithm on a hexagonal coordinate grid. This algorithm is often used for procedural generation and is capable of creating complex, coherent patterns. The use of a hexagonal grid introduces a unique spatial element to the simulations.

Freeze: Implementation of Visualized Node Coding Combined with Platformer, Utilizing Several Machine Learning Algorithms

In the "Freeze" section, you can explore projects involving the implementation of visualized node coding combined with platformer games. This may be a demonstration of how programming can be made more accessible through visual interfaces. Moreover, this section incorporates several machine learning algorithms, suggesting an exploration of AI in the context of gaming or interactive applications.
